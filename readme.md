# ADV ATOMIX Documentation

This repository contains the source files for creating the best practices documentation of the SCOR's working group on Analysing Turbulence Ocean MIXing observations.

 A pdf version will be regularly generated but the most recent version can be found on this [webpage](https://bluteau-cy.github.io/scor_atomix_adv/adv/site/), where eventually you may provide comments directly at the bottom of each page once it's moved to a new account.
