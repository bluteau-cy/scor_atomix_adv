  abstract = {Predicting hydrodynamic forces from ship waves along a waterway is essential for managing a sustainable shoreline in fairways. In this context, a numerical model can be a useful tool for calculating ship waves in fairways with complex geometry. XBeach is a numerical model offering the potential to be a one-tool solution for simulating ship waves from the ship to the shore. However, XBeach has not been evaluated against field measurements of ship waves. Thus, the objective of this paper is (1) to compare XBeach against high-quality field measurements of ship waves and (2) to assess its general applicability to ship wave simulations through an extensive sensitivity analysis with regard to the main input parameters. Water level measurements from 42 passages of the M/S Baltic Princess in the Furusund navigational fairway in the Stockholm Archipelago were chosen to test and evaluate XBeach. The results showed that XBeach was able to generate and propagate the primary and secondary waves. Primary waves were reproduced well with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3Â cm for the drawdown height. The overall secondary wave field pattern was represented by XBeach; however, for the largest, single divergent wave comparison for height, period, and timing showed deviation from the observations. Overall, XBeach was found to be a robust model for ship wave applications, only requiring input data typically available. Sensitivity analysis for a generic hull, derived from the type of vessel studied and with the corresponding dimensions as the real hull, showed similar results enabling robust and reliable simulations without access to detailed technical drawings.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional finite element model is used to calculate the barotropic tides and buoyancy-driven flows along the north coast of British Columbia. The model tides are compared to historical constituent harmonics and results from a previous two-dimensional model for the same region. Apart from improvements due to the inclusion of a bottom Ekman layer, the three-dimensional tidal accuracy is essentially the same as that for the two-dimensional model. However, the tidal residual currents are shown to correspond more closely to observations both around Cape St. James and in Dixon Entrance. The diagnostic, buoyancy-driven calculations are forced with the density fields arising from six water property surveys in Dixon Entrance. The model currents are shown to compare favourably with low-pass filtered current meter observations and velocities deduced from drifter tracks. The Rose Spit Eddy is shown to be a consistent feature in all seasons and, as suggested by Bowman et al., its origin appears to arise from a combination of buoyancy-driven and tidally rectified forcing.},

  abstract = { Various unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) modeling techniques to predict container ship squat in confined water are investigated and compared in this study to assess the suitability of each modeling technique. Five methods are compared, among which three are quasi-statical estimations of squat from computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-computed hydrodynamic forces and moment (QS), and two are based on directly computed squat utilizing dynamic overset meshing (OV) technique. In addition, the effect of self-propulsion on the squat is investigated by comparing different methods of propulsion, i.e., the hull is either towed (T) or self-propelled by means of body-force propulsion virtual disc (VD) model or a fully discretized propeller (DP). The investigation shows that the QS methods tend to be superior in terms of computation efficiency, range of applicability, and trim prediction accuracy. It is also shown that the effect of self-propulsion is significant and should be accounted for to provide accurate results, especially at relatively high speeds. Moreover, virtual disc modeling is more computationally economical while also providing a degree of accuracy similar to that of a discretized propeller. Thus, the most suitable method is the quasi-static method with virtual disc self-propulsion (QS-VD). However, for very shallow cases where h/T \&lt; 1.14, the towed quasi-static squat model (QS-T) is recommended due to better accuracy. },

  abstract = {Coastal and bank erosion along the St. Lawrence River Waterway in Quebec, Canada, represents a hazard to local communities living along the river banks, as well as to the local fauna habitat. The purpose of this study is to assess the potential impact of the waves generated by long containerships on riverbank erosion and recession at critical sites along the St. Lawrence River Waterway, which have already experienced significant damage. A field study was carried out to investigate the ship-generated hydrodynamics and the various driving mechanisms of the erosion process induced by ship waves. The field measurements provided an assessment of the influence of the length of large vessels by comparing the characteristics of the hydrodynamics fields induced by the passage of two containerships of different lengths. The potential for bank erosion and recession is assessed in terms of the wake erosive energy incident to the shoreline. The field data are compared against analytical results predicted by an empirical model, as well as against a ship-generated hydrodynamics model. Several numerical simulations for quantifying the ship’s drawdown and its effects are also presented.},

  abstract  = {Regressions and meta-regressions are widely used to estimate patterns and effect sizes in various disciplines. However, many biological and medical analyses use relatively low sample size (N), contributing to concerns on reproducibility. What is the minimum N to identify the most plausible data pattern using regressions? Statistical power analysis is often used to answer that question, but it has its own problems and logically should follow model selection to first identify the most plausible model. Here we make null, simple linear and quadratic data with different variances and effect sizes. We then sample and use information theoretic model selection to evaluate minimum N for regression models. We also evaluate the use of coefficient of determination (R2) for this purpose; it is widely used but not recommended. With very low variance, both false positives and false negatives occurred at N < 8, but data shape was always clearly identified at N ≥ 8. With high variance, accurate inference was stable at N ≥ 25. Those outcomes were consistent at different effect sizes. Akaike Information Criterion weights (AICc wi) were essential to clearly identify patterns (e.g., simple linear vs. null); R2 or adjusted R2 values were not useful. We conclude that a minimum N = 8 is informative given very little variance, but minimum N ≥ 25 is required for more variance. Alternative models are better compared using information theory indices such as AIC but not R2 or adjusted R2. Insufficient N and R2-based model selection apparently contribute to confusion and low reproducibility in various disciplines. To avoid those problems, we recommend that research based on regressions or meta-regressions use N ≥ 25.},

  abstract  = {AbstractFor measurements from either profiling or moored instruments,
	several processing techniques exist to estimate the dissipation rate
	of turbulent kinetic energy ÃÂÃÂµ, a core quantity used to determine
	oceanic mixing rates. Moored velocimeters can provide long-term measurements
	of ÃÂÃÂµ, but they can be plagued by motion-induced contamination. To
	remove this contamination, two methodologies are presented that use
	independent measurements of the instrumentÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂ¢s acceleration and rotation
	in space. The first is derived from the relationship between the
	spectra (cospectra) and the variance (covariance) of a time series.
	The cospectral technique recovers the environmental (or true) velocity
	spectrum by summing the measured spectrum, the motion-induced spectrum,
	and the cospectrum between the motion-induced and measured velocities.
	The second technique recovers the environmental spectrum by correcting
	the measured spectrum with the squared coherency, essentially assuming
	that the measured signal shares variance with either the environmental
	signal or the motion signal. Both techniques are applied to moored
	velocimeters at 7.5 and 20.5 m above the seabed in 105 m of water.
	By estimating the orbital velocities from their respective spectra
	and comparing them against those obtained from nearby wave measurements,
	the study shows that the surface wave signature is recovered with
	the cospectral technique, while it is underpredicted with the squared
	coherency technique. The latter technique is particularly problematic
	when the instrumentÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂ¢s motion is in phase with the orbital (environmental)
	velocities, as it removes variance that should have been added to
	the measured spectrum. The estimated ÃÂÃÂµ from the cospectral technique
	compares well with estimates from nearby microstructure velocity
	shear vertical profiles.},

  abstract = {We investigated the driving forces of sediment dynamics at the shoals in South San Francisco Bay. Two stations were deployed along a line perpendicular to a 14 m deep channel, 1000 and 2000 m from the middle of the channel. Station depths were 2.59 and 2.19 m below mean lower low water, respectively. We used acoustic Doppler velocimeters for the simultaneous determination of current velocities, turbulence, sediment concentration and fluxes. Maximum current shear velocities were 0.015 m sâ1 at the station further from the channel (closer to the shore) and 0.02 m sâ1 at the station closer to the channel. Peak wave-induced shear velocities exceeded 0.015 m sâ1 at both stations. Maximum sediment concentrations were around 30 g mâ3 during calm periods (root mean square wave height <0.15 m). During wavy periods, sediment concentrations increased to 100 g mâ3 and sediment fluxes were 5 times higher than in calm conditions (0.02 g mâ2 sâ1 versus >0.10 g mâ2 sâ1) at the station further from the channel 0.36 m above the bed. Closer to the channel, sediment concentrations and vertical fluxes due to wind wave resuspension were persistently lower (maximum concentrations around 50 g mâ3 and maximum fluxes around 0.04 g mâ2 sâ1). Most resuspension events occurred during flood tides that followed wave events during low water. Although wave motions are able to resuspend sediment into the wave boundary layer at low tide, the observed large increases in sediment fluxes are due to the nonlinear interaction of wind waves and the tidal currents.},

  abstract = {Abstract Observations from around the global ocean show that enhanced biological activity can be found in anticyclonic eddies. This may mean that upwelling of nutrient-rich water occurs within the eddy, but such upwelling is not captured by models that resolve mesoscale processes. High-resolution simulations presented here show intense submesoscale upwelling from the thermocline to the mixed layer in anticyclonic eddies. The properties of the upwelling are consistent with a process known as symmetric instability. A simple limiting nutrient experiment shows that this upwelling can drive much higher biological activity in anticyclonic eddies when there is a high nutrient concentration in the thermocline. An estimate for the magnitude of upwelling associated with symmetric instability in anticyclonic eddies in the Sargasso Sea shows that it may be of comparable magnitude to other processes, though further work is required to understand the full implications for basin-scale nutrient budgets.},

  abstract = {A unique couplet of basin-wide baroclinic eddies was observed in Dixon Entrance. These eddies were revealed in current meter observations, drifter tracks, and contours of dynamic heights derived from hydrographic measurements. Normally, in a coastal sea strait wider than the internal Rossby radius of deformation, the outflow of brackish water is on the right, looking seaward; but in Dixon Entrance these two eddies force an outflow on the left. Several generation mechanisms for these two eddies are investigated. Calculations of the tidally rectified currents, using current ellipses observed at current meter moorings, suggest that such rectified currents are weak at these locations. However, on the shallow banks and slopes where rectification is expected to be strongest and direct measurements are absent, tidal ellipses generated by numerical models indicate sufficient rectification of currents to spin up the eddies. Current fluctuations at 2-week periods are moderately coherent with fortnightly modulations in the semidiurnal tide, also suggesting that tidal rectification may be important. Wind and estuarine forcing are also investigated. Empirical orthogonal function analysis of the current and wind data reveals that although the most spatially coherent fluctuations in subtidal currents can be attributed to the wind, the average flow cannot. Outflow of brackish water can generate currents of the approprate strength, but not the outflow along the left bank. Although a prevailing wind from the north or west at the western approach to Dixon Entrance might set up this flow, existing wind data for the period of observations indicate a prevailing wind from the southeast. Therefore, the diversion of the brackish water is likely due to the eddies set up by the process of tidal rectification.},

  abstract = {The HNLC waters of the Gulf of Alaska normally receive too little iron for primary productivity to draw down silicate and nitrate in surface waters, even in spring and summer. Our observations of chlorophyll sensed by SeaWiFS north of 54Â°N in pelagic waters (>500m depth) of the gulf found that, on average, more than half of all surface chlorophyll was inside the 4cm contours of anticyclonic mesoscale eddies (the ratio approaches 80\% in spring months), yet these contours enclosed only 10\% of the total surface area of pelagic waters in the gulf. Therefore, eddies dominate the chlorophyll and phytoplankton distribution in surface pelagic waters. We outline several eddy processes that enhance primary productivity. Eddies near the continental margin entrain nutrient â (and Fe) â rich and chlorophyll-rich coastal waters into their outer rings, advecting these waters into the basin interior to directly increase phytoplankton populations there. In addition, eddies carry excess nutrients and iron in their core waters into pelagic regions as they propagate away from the continental margin. As these anticyclonic eddies decay, their depressed isopycnals relax upward, injecting nutrients up toward the surface layer. We propose that this transport brings iron and macro-nutrients toward the surface mixed layer, where they are available for wind-forced mixing to bring them to surface. These mesoscale eddies decay slowly, but steadily, perhaps providing a relatively regular upward supply of macro-nutrients and iron toward euphotic layers. They might behave as isolated oases of enhanced marine productivity in an otherwise iron-poor basin. We note that much of this productivity might be near or just below the base of the surface mixed layer, and therefore poorly sampled by colour-sensing satellites. It is possible, then, that eddies enrich phytoplankton populations to a greater extent than noted from satellite surface observations only.},

  abstract   = {The transport of water through Hecate Strait, British Columbia, is investigated to determine seasonal cycles and to find optimal surrogate series from which a long time series of along‐strait transport can be inferred and applied to fisheries and pollution problems. It is believed that the strength of a year‐class of cod in this Strait varies inversely with the transport in winter. Therefore, a good surrogate series is required, one that extends back in time to compare with fisheries records and will continue into the future to determine fluctuations in the population of these species.

Current meters deployed for an 11‐month period in 1983–84 provide transport measurements. Subsurface pressure gauges were deployed at 10‐m depth at five sites around Hecate Strait for a two‐year period in 1982–84. The cross‐strait difference of pressures determined by two of these gauges (Beauchemin Channel and Atli Inlet) serves as the best transport indicator, with an average correlation coefficient r of 0.88. Longer, continuous series are provided by the records from float‐type sea‐level gauges at Prince Rupert (PR), Queen Charlotte City (QCC) and Bella Bella (BB). Local air pressure is added to these series to convert them to subsurface pressure. Time series of geostrophic and measured winds are also considered. Among these longer series, transport is predicted best by the combination (PR + BB)/2 ‐ QCC (r = 0.82), which represents a cross‐strait difference in subsurface pressure.},

Altimetry measurements from TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-2 satellites suggest that these eddies first appeared near Cape St. James at the southern tip of the islands. The eddies merged in June to form “Haida-1998,” the highest eddy ever observed in the region. Currents near Cape St. James in winter follow complicated patterns attributed to tidal rectification and pressure-driven outflow from Hecate Strait. The adjustment of these flows to the bathymetric features likely contributes to the formation of Haida Eddies. Eddies that first appear farther north along the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands are set up by other processes, such as baroclinic instability.},

  abstract = {A 2-layer non-hydrostatic model with improved dispersive behaviour is presented. Due to the assumption of a constant non-hydrostatic pressure distribution in the lower layer, the dispersive behaviour is improved without much additional computational time. A comparison with linear wave theory showed that this 2-layer model gives a better result for the dispersion relation and shoaling of waves in intermediate water. This means that the 2-layer model is applicable in shallow and intermediate water depths (up to relative depths kh equals 4), whereas the 1-layer model is only applicable in shallow water depths (kh smaller than 1). Three laboratory experiments, including a fringing reef and a barred beach, were used to validate the presented mode for different hydrodynamic conditions. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the 2-layer model can be applied to accurately simulate the bulk wave height and spectral properties. The low frequency wave height, the setup and in particular the second order statistics contain more scatter, but the model accurately captured the general trend. Furthermore, the model showed good results for complex bathymetries in shallow to intermediate water.},

As with a similar analysis to the south, the onset of upwelling and the upwelling season duration are generally found to be arriving later in the year and becoming shorter, respectively. However, statistically significant trends toward increased cumulative upwelling and downwelling are found at most buoys and this is related to previous findings of trends in sea level pressure and winter mixed-layer depth in the northeast Pacific. Impacts on past and future local marine ecosystems are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Quantifying and forecasting the impact of boat traffic on the health of coastal ecosystems must account for the multiscale nature of the process: from minutes (individual wakes), to days (tidal phase), weeks, and longer (tide modulation, seasonal traffic). Direct numerical simulations covering all these scales are difficult, not in the least because specifying the vessel type and navigation characteristics for every wake is practically impossible. To overcome this problem, we propose a statistical-mechanics description of the wake field that focuses on classes of wakes, defined by a set of characteristic parameters, and their joint probability density in the characteristic-parameter space. Here, we demonstrate the first steps of the approach using existing numerical tools and parametrizations. Because vessel type and navigation characteristics are not available, an investigation of wake parameter space is not possible at this time. Instead, we use the leading-order Froude-number parametrization defined by a linear model to classify the wake population observed during the field experiment. Numerical tests applying the FUNWAVE-TVD model across all wake-classes identified show excellent skills for weakly dispersive wakes. The model is challenged by the short waves generated by small, slow boats. However, simulations suggest that the problem is confined to the deeper water domain and linear evolution. Nonlinear wake shoaling, essential for modeling wake-induced sediment transport and wake impact on the environment, is described well.},

  abstract = {Oxygen concentrations in the bottom waters of the Lower St. Lawrence estuary (LSLE) decreased from 125 Âµmol Lâ¢1 (37.7\% saturation) in the 1930s to an average of 65 Âµmol Lâ¢1 (20.7\% saturation) for the 1984-2003 period. A concurrent 1.65Â°C warming of the bottom water from the 1930s to the 1980s suggests that changes in the relative proportions of cold, fresh, oxygen-rich Labrador Current Water (LCW) and warm, salty, oxygen-poor North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) in the water mass entering the Laurentian Channel probably played a role in the oxygen depletion. We estimate that about one half to two thirds of the oxygen loss in the bottom waters of the LSLE can be attributed to a decreased proportion of LCW. This leaves between one third and one half of the oxygen decrease to be explained by causes other than changes in water mass composition. An increase in the along-channel oxygen gradient from Cabot Strait to the LSLE over the past decades, combined with data from sediment cores, suggests that increased sediment oxygen demand may be partly responsible for the remainder of the oxygen decline. In July 2003, approximately 1,300 km2 of seafloor in the LSLE was bathed in hypoxic water (<62.5 Âµmol Lâ1).},

  abstract = {The steady-state energy and thermal variance budgets form the basis for most current methods for evaluating turbulent fluxes of buoyancy, heat, and salinity. This study derives these budgets for a double-diffusive staircase and quantifies them using direct numerical simulations; 10 runs with different Rayleigh numbers are considered. The energy budget is found to be well approximated by a simple three-term balance, while the thermal variance budget consists of only two terms. The two budgets are also combined to give an expression for the ratio of the heat and salt fluxes. The heat flux scaling is also studied and found to agree well with earlier estimates based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations at high Rayleigh numbers. At low Rayleigh numbers, however, the authors find large deviations from earlier scaling laws. Last, the scaling theory of Grossman and Lohse, which was developed for Rayleigh-Bernard convection and is based on the partitioning of the kinetic energy and tracer variance dissipation, is adapted to the diffusive regime of double-diffusive convection. The predicted heat flux scalings are compared to the results from the numerical simulations and earlier estimates.},

  abstract = {We examine the spatial and temporal variability of satellite-sensed sea surface chlorophyll off the west coast of North America from 1997 to 2010, with focus on coastal British Columbia. The variability in surface chlorophyll is complex. Whereas the spring bloom generates the highest phytoplankton concentration for coastal Alaska, the north and east coasts of Haida Gwaii, Queen Charlotte Sound, the Strait of Georgia, and coastal Oregon and California, it is the fall bloom that normally generates the highest concentration for the west coast of Vancouver Island, Juan de Fuca Strait, and the west coast of Washington. The highest satellite-sensed chlorophyll concentrations occur in the Strait of Georgia, where mean values are at least 2 times higher than elsewhere in the northeast Pacific. Moreover, the annual average surface chlorophyll concentration increased significantly in the Strait of Georgia during this period, with highest concentration observed during the near neutral ENSO conditions of the spring of 2007. The next highest concentrations occur off southwest Vancouver Island but have no statistically significant trend. The lowest average peak chlorophyll concentration is observed off Southern California. The timing of the highest chlorophyll concentration is latest off the coast of Washington and earliest off the coast of Southern California. Small increasing concentration trends are observed off the Washington and California coasts.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the nature and extent of methane production and flux in aquatic sediments has important geochemical, geotechnical, and global climate change implications. Quantifying these processes is difficult, because much of the methane flux in shallow sediments occurs via ebullition (bubbling). Direct observation of bubble formation is not possible, and bubbling is episodic and dependent upon a number of factors. Whereas previous studies have correlated methane flux with surface wind intensity, detailed study of Lake Gatun in Panama and Lago Loiza in Puerto Rico suggest that methane flux is more closely correlated with the shear stress in sediments caused by bottom currents. Bottom currents in turn are a complex function of wind, internal pressure gradients, and lake bathymetry. A simple physical model of bottom currents and sediments in these lakes suggests that most methane ebullition originated from the upper 10-20 cm of the sediment column. Our data reaffirm previous studies showing that ebullitive methane flux is minor in water deeper than Ã¢Âï¿½?5 m.},

  abstract = {We investigated the response of nutrient cycling in the Lower St.Lawrence Estuary (LSLE) to perturbations, using a linear three-box model that reflects summer stratification. The model is used to (i) test the sensitivity of each layers nutrient concentration (fixed-nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica) to perturbations in nutrient and water volume inputs to the LSLE, (ii) compute the response time of the system to a new steady state following a perturbation, and (iii) estimate the amount of oxygen consumed by respiration as bottom waters are advected through the LSLE. We find that the system adjusts rapidly to perturbations (half a year to reach 90\% of the new steady state under a doubling of river input nutrient concentration). Most of the dissolved nutrients (60\% of the fixed-nitrogen, 85\% of the soluble reactive phosphate) that reach the surface waters in the LSLE originate from deeper waters. This dampens the effect of nutrients of anthropogenic origin on eutrophication (a doubling of river input nutrient concentration will lead to less than a doubling of bottom-water respiration rates). Our nutrient budget suggests that the Lower St.Lawrence Estuary acts as a nutrient pump for the Gulf of St.Lawrence and nitrate appears to be the limiting nutrient to surface productivity in the LSLE. This model can be used to test the impact of natural or anthropogenic perturbations on nutrient in the LSLE and oxygen concentrations in its bottom waters.},

Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations between September 1997 and February 2018 were used to investigate long-term trends in phytoplankton biomass and size structure (microphytoplankton [>20 μm], nanophytoplankton [2–20 μm], and picophytoplankton [<2 μm]) in the Northern Benguela, Southern Benguela (SB), and Agulhas Bank (AB) shelf and open ocean regions of the BUS. Trends in upwelling and correlations with Chla and size structure were examined. Increasing Chla and microphytoplankton trends occurred in the Northern Benguela shelf and open ocean, while decreases were evident on the SB shelf in all seasons. In the SB open ocean, small increases occurred during austral winter, with a decrease in spring. On the AB shelf, increases in Chla and microphytoplankton occurred in summer with decreases during the other seasons. Patterns differed in the AB open ocean, with increases in winter and spring and decreases in summer and autumn. Although R2 values indicated that linear trends accounted for a reasonable portion of the variance, and most trends were statistically significant, they showed only small changes on the shelf domains and little to no change in the open ocean. Strong correlations between upwelling, Chla, and the size classes were observed, but distinct seasonal differences occurred in each region. This is the first 20-year analysis of phytoplankton biomass and community structure in the BUS and provides a baseline against which future changes can be monitored.},

Typical temperature-depth curves indicate that the temperature of the deep layer reaches a maximum at about 250Ã¢ÂÂm. which shows little or no seasonal variations. Observations show warming of the deep layer from the 1920's to the 1950's. This upward trend of temperatures is accompanied by an increase in volume of the deep layer. The deep layer consists of a mixture of "Labrador" and "Slope" waters in which the mixing ratio of the components remains fairly constant from year to year. Fluctuations in temperature of "Labrador" water are reflected by a corresponding change in temperature of the deep layer in the Laurentian Channel. The vertical structure of the waters in the lower Laurentian Channel and the transport of the waters in Cabot Strait suggest that in the deep layers, there is a continuing supply of oceanic waters to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent experimental measurements of fluorescence values and turbulent energy dissipation rates, recorded in weakly stratified boundary layers in the open ocean, have highlighted a significant correlation between the formation of deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) and turbulent mixing. Specifically, the depth of many DCM are observed to lie below, but within about one standard deviation, of the point at which the energy dissipation rate profile reaches its maximum. This correlation of DCM and turbulent mixing is both exciting and curious, as conventional thinking tends to see the latter as a destructive rather than a constructive agent in regards to the formation of deep biological maxima (DBM), for which DCM data is usually interpreted as a proxy. In order to investigate this phenomenon, a three-dimensional large eddy simulation (LES) of the ocean boundary layer was combined with a generic nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) type biological model, in order establish what mechanisms might be driving the experimental observations. Simulations of the LES-NPZ model, based upon various sets of generic biological parameters, demonstrate DCM/DBM formation occurs at normalized depths close to those seen in the experimental observations. The simulations support the hypothesis that the DBM are generated by a combination of zooplankton predation pressure curtailing phytoplankton growth near the surface, and a decline in the strength of the vertical mixing processes advecting nutrient through the boundary layer. In tandem, these produce a region of the water column in which predation pressure is relatively low and nutrient aggregation relatively high, suitable conditions for DBM formation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an extension of the XBeach-G numerical model with a sediment transport and morphology module, which includes the effect of groundwater ventilation and flow inertia on sediment transport, to simulate the morphodynamic response of pure gravel beaches and barriers to storms. The morphodynamic XBeach-G model is validated by simulating the morphodynamic response of one laboratory and four natural gravel barriers to 10 separate storm events, where the observed morphodynamic response ranged from berm building to barrier rollover. Model results show that XBeach-G is capable of reproducing the type of morphodynamic response of the barrier well in qualitative and quantitative sense (median BSS 0.75), with higher skill for more energetic storm conditions. Inclusion of acceleration forces on coarse gravel beaches is shown to significantly increase model skill and may be essential in modelling these types of beaches. The effect of varying hydraulic conductivity within estimated and published ranges is shown to be of secondary importance. The range of validation cases and lack of site-specific calibration show that XBeach-G can be applied to predict storm impacts on pure gravel beaches and barriers with reasonable to high confidence for a range of hydrodynamic forcing conditions and barrier response types.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a process-based numerical model for the prediction of storm hydrodynamics and hydrology on gravel beaches. The model comprises an extension of an existing open-source storm-impact model for sandy coasts (XBeach), through the application of (1) a non-hydrostatic pressure correction term that allows wave-by-wave modelling of the surface elevation and depth-averaged flow, and (2) a groundwater model that allows infiltration and exfiltration through the permeable gravel bed to be simulated, and is referred to as XBeach-G. Although the model contains validated sediment transport relations for sandy environments, transport relations for gravel in the model are currently under development and unvalidated. Consequently, all simulations in this paper are carried out without morphodynamic feedback. Modelled hydrodynamics are validated using data collected during a large-scale physical model experiment and detailed in-situ field data collected at Loe Bar, Cornwall, UK, as well as remote-sensed data collected at four gravel beach locations along the UK coast during the 2012Ã¢ÂÂ2013 storm season. Validation results show that the model has good skill in predicting wave transformation (overall SCI 0.14Ã¢ÂÂ0.21), run-up levels (SCI <0.12; median error <10%) and initial wave overtopping (85Ã¢ÂÂ90% prediction rate at barrier crest), indicating that the model can be applied to estimate potential storm impact on gravel beaches. The inclusion of the non-hydrostatic pressure correction term and groundwater model is shown to significantly improve the prediction and evolution of overtopping events.},

Historically this has been seen to be a relatively straightforward task and the methods are well known. Such re-processing can result in the loss of real signal since the detrending and averaging methods act as high-pass filters. We review the main methods used to separate the active, turbulent transport that we treat as eddy flux from the slower, deterministic atmospheric motions and instrument drift. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms used in averaging, detrending and filtering and conclude that the best method is likely to be dependent on site conditions and data processing system in use. We recommend the use of the ogive to determine the optimal averaging period at any site. We illustrate outstanding issues with data from a number of FLUXNET sites.},

  abstract = {Difficulties to quantify ocean turbulence have limited our knowledge about the magnitude and variability of nitrate turbulent diffusion, which constitutes one of the main processes responsible for the supply of nitrogen to phytoplankton inhabiting the euphotic zone. We use an extensive dataset of microturbulence observations collected in contrasting oceanic regions, to build a model for nitrate diffusion into the euphotic zone, and obtain the first global map for the distribution of this process. A model including two predictors (surface temperature and nitrate vertical gradient) explained 50\% of the variance in the nitrate diffusive flux. This model was applied to climatological data to predict nitrate diffusion in oligotrophic mid and low latitude regions. Mean nitrate diffusion ({\textasciitilde}â20 Tmol N yâ1) was comparable to nitrate entrainment due to seasonal mixed-layer deepening between 40Â°Nâ40ÂºS, and to the sum of global estimates of nitrogen fixation, fluvial fluxes and atmospheric deposition. These results indicate that nitrate diffusion represents one of the major sources of new nitrogen into the surface ocean in these regions.},

  abstract = {The diffusive layering (DL) form of double-diffusive convection cools the Atlantic Water (AW) as it circulates around the Arctic Ocean. Large DL steps, with heights of homogeneous layers often greater than 10 m, have been found above the AW core in the Eurasian Basin (EB) of the eastern Arctic. Within these DL staircases, heat and salt fluxes are determined by the mechanisms for vertical transport through the high-gradient regions (HGRs) between the homogeneous layers. These HGRs can be thick (up to 5 m and more) and are frequently complex, being composed of multiple small steps or continuous stratification. Microstructure data collected in the EB in 2007 and 2008 are used to estimate heat fluxes through large steps in three ways: using the measured dissipation rate in the large homogeneous layers; utilizing empirical flux laws based on the density ratio and temperature step across HGRs after scaling to account for the presence of multiple small DL interfaces within each HGR; and averaging estimates of heat fluxes computed separately for individual small interfaces (as laminar conductive fluxes), small convective layers (via dissipation rates within small DL layers), and turbulent patches (using dissipation rate and buoyancy) within each HGR. Diapycnal heat fluxes through HGRs evaluated by each method agree with each other and range from ~2 to ~8 W m-2, with an average flux of ~3-4 W m-2. These large fluxes confirm a critical role for the DL instability in cooling and thickening the AW layer as it circulates around the eastern Arctic Ocean.},

  abstract  = {Maritime transport carries around 80\% of the world{\textquoteright}s trade. It is key to the economic development of many countries, it is a source of income in many countries, and it is considered as a safe and environment friendly mode of transport. Given its undisputed importance, a question is what does the future hold for maritime transport. This chapter is an attempt to answer this question by mainly addressing the drive to decarbonize shipping, along with related challenges as regards alternative low carbon or zero carbon marine fuels. The important role of maritime policy making as a main driver for change is also discussed. Specifically, if maritime transport is to drastically change so as to meet carbon emissions reduction targets, the chapter argues, among other things, that a substantial bunker levy would be the best (or maybe the only) way to induce technological changes in the long run and logistical measures (such as slow steaming) in the short run. In the long run this would lead to changes in the global fleet towards vessels and technologies that are more energy efficient, more economically viable and less dependent on fossil fuels than those today. In that sense, it would have the potential to drastically alter the face of maritime transport in the future. However, as things stand, and mainly for political reasons, the chapter also argues that the adoption of such a measure is considered as rather unlikely.},

The results presented herein suggest that coasts fronted by relatively narrow reefs with steep fore reef slopes (~1:10 and steeper) and deeper, smoother reef flats are expected to experience the highest wave runup. Wave runup increases for higher water levels (sea level rise), higher waves, and lower bed roughness (coral degradation), which are all expected effects of climate change. Rising sea levels and climate change will therefore have a significant negative impact on the ability of coral reefs to mitigate the effects of coastal hazards in the future.},

  abstract = {The character of ships' wakes and the consequent sediment resuspension induced by the passage of commercial vessels in Venice Lagoon, Italy was investigated during July, 2009. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water depth, and water velocity were measured on the shoals alongside the shipping channel after the passage of forty vessels. The ships' passage produced large waves of depression with troughs oriented at an average angle of 44° to the channel. High water velocities are recorded opposite the direction of wave propagation and may exceed 2m s−1 at the rear edge of the trough. Ten vessel-induced wakes led to SSC concentrations above 400mg L−1, ~30 times higher than the average background concentration. When large wakes passed over the shoals, maximum concentrations persisted for several minutes and elevated concentrations persisted for nearly an hour. The height of a ship's wake can be related to the product of the depth-based Froude number, Fr, and a blocking coefficient, S, according to Fr3.5S1.6. Because of the sensitivity of the height of the wake to the ship's speed, we suggest a method for calculation of a ship-by-ship velocity threshold below which shear stress does not exceed the critical erosive stress level for sediments.},

  abstract = {A new nearshore numerical model approach to assess the natural coastal response during time-varying storm and hurricane conditions, including dune erosion, overwash and breaching, is validated with a series of analytical, laboratory and field test cases. Innovations include a non-stationary wave driver with directional spreading to account for wave-group generated surf and swash motions and an avalanching mechanism providing a smooth and robust solution for slumping of sand during dune erosion. The model performs well in different situations including dune erosion, overwash and breaching with specific emphasis on swash dynamics, avalanching and 2DH effects; these situations are all modelled using a standard set of parameter settings. The results show the importance of infragravity waves in extending the reach of the resolved processes to the dune front. The simple approach to account for slumping of the dune face by avalanching makes the model easily applicable in two dimensions and applying the same settings good results are obtained both for dune erosion and breaching.},

  abstract = {We present evidence for a narrow, poleward flowing surface current over the continental slope of northwestern British Columbia and southwestern Alaska. Named for a prominent native Indian tribe of the region, the Haida Current occurs predominantly between October and April. Maximal flow takes place in midwinter from November through February. Characteristic features of the current include a minimal extent of 200–300 km, a width of 20–30 km, a depth scale of 500 m, and near-surface temperature signatures of up to +1°C within the core of the current, as well as large-amplitude O(10 km) mesoscale waves and eddies along its flank. The wind stress and alongshore sea surface slope are shown to be the primary driving mechanisms for the current.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aquatic vegetation in the coastal zone attenuates wave energy and reduces the risk of coastal hazards, e.g., flooding. Besides the attenuation of sea-swell waves, vegetation may also affect infragravity-band (IG) waves and wave setup. To date, knowledge on the effect of vegetation on IG waves and wave setup is lacking, while they are potentially important parameters for coastal risk assessment. In this study, the storm impact model XBeach is extended with formulations for attenuation of sea-swell and IG waves, and wave setup effects in two modes: the sea-swell wave phase-resolving (nonhydrostatic) and the phase-averaged (surfbeat) mode. In surfbeat mode, a wave shape model is implemented to capture the effect of nonlinear wave-vegetation interaction processes on wave setup. Both modeling modes are verified using data from two flume experiments with mimic vegetation and show good skill in computing the sea-swell and IG wave transformation, and wave setup. In surfbeat mode, the wave setup prediction greatly improves when using the wave shape model, while in nonhydrostatic mode (nonlinear) intrawave effects are directly accounted for. Subsequently, the model is used for a range of coastal geomorphological configurations by varying bed slope and vegetation extent. The results indicate that the effect of wave-vegetation interaction on wave setup may be relevant for a range of typical coastal geomorphological configurations (e.g., relatively steep to gentle slope coasts fronted by vegetation).},

Findings reveal a marked alongshore variation in retained primary production that is highly correlated with the alongshore variation in resident fish yield. The highest productivity occurs off the coasts of Washington and southern British Columbia. Zooplankton data for coastal British Columbia confirm strong bottom-up trophic linkages between phytoplankton, zooplankton, and resident fish, extending to regional areas as small as 10,000 square kilometers.},

  abstract = {A new Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is presented. This new approach consists of sifting an ensemble of white noise-added signal (data) and treats the mean as the final true result. Finite, not infinitesimal, amplitude white noise is necessary to force the ensemble to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process, thus making the different scale signals to collate in the proper intrinsic mode functions (IMF) dictated by the dyadic filter banks. As EEMD is a time–space analysis method, the added white noise is averaged out with sufficient number of trials; the only persistent part that survives the averaging process is the component of the signal (original data), which is then treated as the true and more physical meaningful answer. The effect of the added white noise is to provide a uniform reference frame in the time–frequency space; therefore, the added noise collates the portion of the signal of comparable scale in one IMF. With this ensemble mean, one can separate scales naturally without any a priori subjective criterion selection as in the intermittence test for the original EMD algorithm. This new approach utilizes the full advantage of the statistical characteristics of white noise to perturb the signal in its true solution neighborhood, and to cancel itself out after serving its purpose; therefore, it represents a substantial improvement over the original EMD and is a truly noise-assisted data analysis (NADA) method.},

  abstract  = {An investigation based on in-situ surveys combined with remote sensing and GIS analysis revealed fast shoreline retreat on the side of a major waterway, the Malamocco Marghera Channel, in the Lagoon of Venice, Italy. Monthly and long-term regression rates caused by ship wakes in a reclaimed industrial area were considered. The short-term analysis, based on field surveys carried out between April 2014 and January 2015, revealed that the speed of shoreline regression was insignificantly dependent on the distance from the navigation channel, but was not constant through time. Periods of high water levels due to tidal forcing or storm surges, more common in the winter season, are characterized by faster regression rates. The retreat is a discontinuous process in time and space depending on the morpho-stratigraphy and the vegetation cover of the artificial deposits. A GIS analysis performed with the available imagery shows an average retreat of 3˗4 m/yr in the period between 1974 and 2015. Digitization of historical maps and bathymetric surveys made in April 2015 enabled the construction of two digital terrain models for both past and present situations. The two models have been used to calculate the total volume of sediment lost during the period 1968˗2015 (1.19×106 m3). The results show that in the presence of heavy ship traffic, ship-channel interactions can dominate the morphodynamics of a waterway and its margins. The analysis enables a better understanding of how shallow-water systems react to the human activities in the post-industrial period. An adequate evaluation of the temporal and spatial variation of shoreline position is also crucial for the development of future scenarios and for the sustainable management port traffic worldwide.},
